# Horeca Service Page
Hi there
My name is [Mohammad Shafqat Siddiqui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-shafqat-siddiqui/) and I alone completed below challenge without any help
Please keep in mind that I didn't worked on shopify portal before this challenge and I did my best to complete all these below challenges

## For test1a that is mentioned in Challenge PDF:
    -I simply copy and past theme.css file to my local machine because i don't want to waste any time with this part and fter that i change theme.css path in all html pages.
    -On line number 1767 on test1a.html file i've added "getInTouch" id tag
    -And similarly on line 2780 i've added "get_in_touch" id tag for auto scroll feature
    -After that i created a js file called "get_in_touch.js" for scroll feature
    Unfortunately i didn't able to implment that data should be saved on Shopify back-end with the tag < Horeca. Because i am not familiar with shopify platform and i don't want to use any kind of ai for this challenge because it's my assignment and i want to give my best to solve this challenge

## For test1b that is mentioned in Challenge PDF:
