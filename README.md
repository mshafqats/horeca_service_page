# Horeca Service Page
Hello and welcome!

My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-shafqat-siddiqui/" target="_blank">Mohammad Shafqat Siddiqui</a>, and I am pleased to present this project that I completed independently. I took on this challenge without prior experience with the Shopify platform and completed all tasks on my own, dedicating my full effort to solve the given challenges.

Please note that while I wasn't able to implement the functionality to save data on Shopify's backend with the tag <Horeca>, this was due to my limited familiarity with the platform. I chose not to rely on any AI tools during this project, as I wanted to ensure the work is entirely my own.

## Task Breakdown
### Test 1a (Challenge PDF)
    I quickly acquired the theme.css file by copying it to my local machine to save time, and then updated the path in all the HTML pages.
    On line 1767 of the test1a.html file, I added the getInTouch ID for the scroll functionality.
    Similarly, on line 2780, I added the get_in_touch ID tag to facilitate the auto-scroll feature.
    I also created a new JavaScript file named get_in_touch.js to handle the scrolling behavior.

## Test 1b (Challenge PDF)
    On line 1983 of the test1b.html file, I introduced a new "Customer Reviews" section.
    I added an "Add Review" button to allow users to create new reviews.
    Additionally, I added an static review entries to showcase the functionality.

## Test 1c (Challenge PDF)
    Finding the appropriate online image links took some time, but I successfully managed to gather all necessary resources.
    Custom styles were added in the custom.css file, which is imported on line 995 of the HTML.
    I implemented the image carousel feature between lines 1893 and 1999 of the HTML file.
    The JavaScript code for the carousel was added between lines 5662 and 5685.
